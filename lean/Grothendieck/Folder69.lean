# Folder 69, pages 25–26: the automorphisms of the 27-line graph fixing a triangle

The modernised reading `transcripts/69/69.modern.tex` (§ 9, « Un triangle marqué »,
pages 25 to 31) describes the graph `C` of the twenty-seven lines of a cubic surface
(two lines joined when they meet) with a marked triangle `t`, and states as a
corollary of the description (page 26)

> `1 → Ψ̃ → W_t → 𝔖_t × 𝔖_{V*} → 1`, `card W_t = 32 · 36 = 1152 = 51 840 / 45`,

`W_t` being the group of automorphisms of `(C, t)`; page 25 gives the subgroup `W'_t`
fixing `t` pointwise, of order `192`.

This is the reachable part of finding `69-triangle-q8-baer-torsor` of
`src/content/findings.ts`: the order, by a finite computation on the graph. Proving it
says only that the count holds; whether the description by a `Q₈`-Baer torsor is in the
literature is a separate question.

What is formalised. The vertices are `Fin 27`: `aᵢ = i`, `bᵢ = 6 + i` (`0 ≤ i < 6`) and
`c_{ij} = 12 + k` for the `k`-th pair `i < j` in lexicographic order; `aᵢ` meets `bⱼ`
iff `i ≠ j`, `aᵢ` and `bᵢ` meet `c_{jk}` iff `i ∈ {j, k}`, `c_{ij}` meets `c_{kl}` iff
`{i, j} ∩ {k, l} = ∅`. The triangle is `t = {a₀, b₁, c₀₁}`.

* `card_Wt`: the permutations of the vertices preserving the graph and `t` form a group
  of order `1152`; `card_aut`: the same for the graph automorphisms `C ≃g C` preserving
  `t`.
* `card_pointwise`: those fixing `t` pointwise form a group of order `192`.
* `degree_eq` (every line meets ten others) and `isTriangle_t`.

The proof is a stabiliser chain: the base `a₀, b₁, a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄` has orbits of sizes
`3, 2, 8, 4, 3, 2` (`3 · 2 · 8 · 4 · 3 · 2 = 1152`); each orbit is contained in the set
of vertices with the same incidences with the points already fixed, and exhausted by
explicit automorphisms (`g0_7`, …, `g5_5`), checked by the kernel; an automorphism
fixing the base fixes everything, since the base separates the vertices.

/-! ## Problem 18 of `docs/problems/article.tex`: the group of a marked triangle

Pages 25 and 26 describe `Aut(C, t)` as an extension of `𝔖_t × 𝔖_{V*}` by a group `Ψ̃` of
order 32, the Baer product of the three pull-backs of the quaternion group `Q₈ = Ṽ` along the
projections of `Ψ(V, t) = Ker(V^t → V)`. Concretely, `Ψ̃` is the group of triples
`(q₁, q₂, q₃)` of quaternions whose product is central (so that their images in `V = Q₈/{±1}`
sum to zero), modulo the central triples `(ε₁, ε₂, ε₃)` with `ε₁ε₂ε₃ = 1`.

The statement is the `Prop` `problem18`, proved below (`problem18_holds`): `φ` is the action
on the three lines of `t` and on the three partitions `V*`, checked to be onto on explicit
elements; `H → Ker φ` is `(a, b, c) ↦ U(a) V(c) Z^s` (`b = a c s`) for a table of
seventeen automorphisms, a homomorphism by the relations between `U`, `V` and `Z` (finite
kernel computations), onto because `card H / 4 = 32 = card W_t / 36` (`card_Wt`). The rest
of the page (the reconstruction of the graph from `(t, V, P̃)`, the characterisation of `Ψ̃`
by the anisotropy conditions, the equivalence of categories) is not formalised. -/

/-! ### Proof

`φ = (φ₁, φ₂)`: `φ₁` is the action on the three lines of `t`; `φ₂` the action on the three
partitions `{2, 3 | 4, 5}`, `{2, 4 | 3, 5}`, `{2, 5 | 3, 4}` of the four other triangles
through each line of `t` (the `V*` of page 26). They are read on the 144 ordered pairs
`(x, y)` of skew lines outside `t` meeting the same line of `t`: two such pairs are in the
same class iff the number of incidences (meeting or equal) between them is even. Writing
`b = a c s` (`s = ±1`) for `(a, b, c) ∈ H`, the map `H → Ψ̃` is `(a, b, c) ↦ U(a) V(c) Z^s`,
where `U(q)`, `V(q)`, `Z` are the images of `(q, q, 1)`, `(1, q, q)`, `(1, 1, -1)`: `U` and
`V` are homomorphisms, `Z` is central and `V(c) U(a) = U(a) V(c) Z^{[c, a] ≠ 1}`, which
makes it a homomorphism; it is onto by counting (`card_Wt`). -/
