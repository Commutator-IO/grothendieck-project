# Folder 145, pages 34–35: the unit-exponent exercise

The modernised reading `transcripts/145/145.modern.tex` (« Les rectificateurs triviaux »,
pages 34 and 35) reduces the profinite case of the trivial-rectifier systems to the
statement (14), which the page leaves as « Exercice ! »: in the free profinite group on
`l₀, l₁`, with `l_∞ l₁ l₀ = 1`, a unit `p ∈ ℤ̂*` satisfies

  `l_∞^p l₁^p l₀^p = 1  ⟹  p = 1`.

This is finding `145-unit-exponent-exercise` of `src/content/findings.ts`; the proof is
the edition's (a dihedral quotient). Proving it says only that the claim holds as stated;
whether it stands in the literature is a separate question.

What is formalised.

mathlib has no free profinite group and no `ℤ̂`-powers. A relation holds in the free
profinite group on `l₀, l₁` iff it holds for every image of `(l₀, l₁)` in every finite
group, and `p ∈ ℤ̂` acts on a finite group `G` through its residue modulo `card G`. So
`p` is a compatible family of residues `p n ∈ ZMod n` (`n ≠ 0`), `x ^ p` in a finite
group `G` is `x ^ (p (card G)).val` (`hatPow`), and (14) for `p` is `Rel14 p`: for every
finite group `G` and `x y z : G` with `z * y * x = 1`, `z^p * y^p * x^p = 1`.

* `dihedral_witness`: for an odd integer `m` and `N ≠ 0`, in `DihedralGroup N` the
  reflections `x = sr 1`, `y = sr 0` and `z = (y x)⁻¹` satisfy `z^m y^m x^m = 1` iff
  `m ≡ 1 (mod N)`.
* `rel14_iff` (the exercise): if `p 2 = 1` — `p` odd, which a unit of `ℤ̂` is — then
  `Rel14 p` iff `p n = 1` for every `n ≠ 0`. `rel14_unit_iff` is the page's form, with
  `p` a unit.
* `rel14_zero`: the oddness cannot be dropped, `p = 0` satisfies (14).

So the exercise holds, more generally: only the oddness of `p` is used, not that `p` is
a unit at the odd primes. The compatibility of the family is used only to pass from
`p (2N)` to `p N` and to `p 2`.
