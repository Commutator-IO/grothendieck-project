# Folder 80, pages 39–54: the sign algebra behind the three-pencil case

Finding `80-skeleton-full-faithfulness`. `Folder80Maps3` proves page 54 for every bigon-free
arrangement in which each triangle has a fourth line through none of its vertices. What it
leaves is the case where every other line passes through a vertex of some triangle: the
arrangement lies in three pencils, the complete quadrangle `III₆` being the first example.

This file closes that case by another route, through chirotopes. A chirotope is written
additively, `χ i j l : ZMod 2` being the sign bit of the triple (`0` for `+`, `1` for `-`),
defined on the *bases*, the triples of pairwise distinct lines with no common point. An
isomorphism of labelled skeleta gives, along each line `i`, the same points in the same cyclic
order up to reversal; by the representation theorem in rank 2 the two contractions at `i` then
differ by a sign `s i` and a reorientation `ε i`:
`χ' (σ i) (σ j) (σ l) = χ i j l + s i + ε i j + ε i l` (`LocallyEquivalent`).

**What is proved.**
* `eq_zero_of_fourth`: if a sign function is, at each line `i`, of the form
  `ψ i j l = δ i j + δ i l`, it vanishes on a triangle that has a fourth line through none of
  its vertices (the four triples of four lines in general position have equal values, and their
  sum is zero).
* `eq_zero`: in a bigon-free incidence structure where two lines meet once, it vanishes on every
  triangle. A triangle `a, b, c` without a fourth line is split at `a` by a line `x` through
  `b ∩ c`, which exists because `a` carries a third vertex; the triangles `a, b, x` and `a, x, c`
  have fourth lines through `a ∩ c` and `a ∩ b`, which exist because `b` and `c` carry third
  vertices.
* `reorientation_of_locallyEquivalent`: **steps 2–4.** If the two chirotopes are locally
  equivalent along every line, `χ' ∘ σ` is the reorientation of `χ` by `s`.
* `const_add_cut`, `locallyEquivalent_of_sameSeparation`: **the rank-2 step.** On a complete
  multipartite graph with at least three parts, a sign function balanced on every 4-cycle is a
  constant plus a cut. Along a line, the 4-cycle sums of `χ` are its separation relation (which
  pair of vertices separates which on the line), so two chirotopes with the same separation
  relation along every line are locally equivalent.
* `reorientation_of_sameSeparation`: **steps 1–4 together.**

**Not formalised.** Folkman–Lawrence, which turns the reorientation into a homeomorphism of the
projective plane, and the fact that on an actual arrangement the separation relation along `i`
is the one the cyclic order of the vertices of `L_i` records.

/-! ### The rank-2 step

Along a line `i`, the other lines fall into classes, one per vertex of `i`. A sign function on
pairs of lines in distinct classes is *balanced* when its sum over every 4-cycle of the complete
multipartite graph is `0`. For the product of two chirotopes, this says that the two contractions
at `i` have the same separation relation: `{j, k}` separates `{l, m}` on `i` iff
`χ i j l + χ i j m + χ i k l + χ i k m = 1`, and that is what the cyclic order of the vertices
along `i`, up to reversal, records. -/
