# Folder 156-6, pages 40, 44 and 49–50: closed parts, the lemma on `φ ↦ φ⁻¹`, trivial ateliers

The modernised reading `transcripts/156-6/156-6.modern.tex` (chapter VI, « Analysis situs
(deuxième mouture) », 18–22 June 1986) works throughout with an ordered set and its *closed*
(= down-closed) parts, the closed sets of the Alexandrov topology of the order. Three statements
of the folder are proved here.

**Page 49, the Lemma.** For two ordered sets `I`, `I'`, the map `φ ↦ φ⁻¹` from increasing maps
`I → I'` to maps `𝔓_f(I') → 𝔓_f(I)` between closed parts is injective, and its image is formed
of the maps commuting with arbitrary unions and intersections. The page first wrote
« préordonnés » and struck the « pré ».

* `pull_iSup₂`, `pull_iInf₂`: `φ⁻¹` commutes with arbitrary unions and intersections.
* `pull_injective`: `φ ↦ φ⁻¹` is injective when `I'` is ordered.
* `exists_pull`: every map of closed parts commuting with arbitrary unions and intersections is
  a `φ⁻¹` — `I'` may be a mere preorder here.
* `Indisc`, `not_pull_injective_preorder`: for a preorder injectivity fails (a two-point set
  where each point is `≤` the other; the identity and the exchange have the same `φ⁻¹`). The
  struck « pré » is needed.
* `topOnly`, `topOnly_sInf`, `topOnly_sup`, `topOnly_bot`, `topOnly_ne_pull`: on `ℕ`, the map
  `𝔓_f(ℕ) → 𝔓_f(pt)` sending `ℕ` to the point and every other closed part to `∅` commutes with
  arbitrary intersections and finite unions but is no `φ⁻¹`. « Arbitrary » unions cannot be
  weakened to finite ones without passing, as the page's margin does, to the sobrification of
  `I'`: the closed part `ℕ` is irreducible without a generic point.

**Page 40, the Example.** In `𝔉 = 𝔓(I)` ordered by inclusion, a closed part is a family of parts
stable under passing to parts — an abstract simplicial complex — and it is *spécieuse* (stable
under the unions of families bounded in `𝔉`, i.e. of all families) iff it is `𝔓(I')` for a part
`I'` of `I`.

* `specious_iff`: the equivalence, for any set `I`.
* `finset_mem_of_union`, `specious_of_union`: when `I` is finite, stability under the union of
  two simplices suffices, as the page says (« la réunion de simplexes est un simplexe »).
* `finite_parts_not_specious`: for `I = ℕ` it does not; the finite parts of `ℕ` are stable
  under binary unions without being any `𝔓(I')`. The page's restriction « du moins si `I` est
  fini » is needed.

**Pages 44 and 49–50, the trivial ateliers.** Page 44 builds an atelier from any ordered set
`(𝓜, ≤)` by taking `≪ := ≤`; its lieux are then the minimal elements, and the small shadow of a
multistrate `Y` is `omb Y = {x minimal | x ≤ Y}`. The axiom of lieux At 8 (page 45) asks that
every `X` have a lieu `x ∈ omb X` lying in no `omb Y`, `Y < X`. Page 49 renders it as « `x`
minimal, `x ≤ X`, `∄ Y` with `x ≤ Y < X` » and calls it « des plus restrictives ».

* `at8_iff`, `at8_iff_discrete`: At 8 holds in a trivial atelier iff every element of `𝓜` is
  minimal, i.e. iff `≤` is equality.
* `at8Cover_not_at8`: the « successeur » reading (`x` covered by `X`: no `Y` with
  `x < Y < X`), which the page's parenthesis seems to intend, is strictly weaker; the chain
  `false < true` satisfies it and not At 8.

**What the formalisation finds.** The Lemma of page 49 holds as the reading states it, for
ordered sets, and only for them: the struck « pré » is confirmed, and the hypothesis on
arbitrary unions cannot be weakened to finite ones. Existence needs no antisymmetry on `I'`;
only uniqueness does. The Example of page 40 holds, and its restriction to a finite `I` is
needed for the binary form. At 8 forces a trivial atelier to be discrete, as the reading's
footnote says: « des plus restrictives » understates it. The ateliers themselves (At 1–At 7,
figures, `≪` on `𝔉`) are not encoded; only the ordered sets and their closed parts are.
