# Way-below opens, core-compactness, scattered spaces, products of quasi-sober spaces

Declarations a proof of this repository (`Grothendieck.Folder161_3`, the topos of a product)
needed and that Mathlib does not have at the pinned revision: the way-below relation on
opens, core-compact spaces, scattered spaces (every nonempty subset has a relatively isolated
point) with their `T0Space` and `QuasiSober` instances, and the instance making an arbitrary
product of quasi-sober spaces quasi-sober. They keep the names the proof used; drop a
declaration once Mathlib has it.
