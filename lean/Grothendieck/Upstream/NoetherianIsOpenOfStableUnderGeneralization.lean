# Backport of the mathlib4 branch `mycaule/noetherian-isOpen-of-stableUnderGeneralization`

Declarations a proof of this repository needed and that were proposed to mathlib4 from
the fork mycaule/mathlib4,
branch `mycaule/noetherian-isOpen-of-stableUnderGeneralization`, closed upstream on
2026-10-22. They keep their mathlib names, against the pinned Mathlib; drop a
declaration once Mathlib has it.
