# Backport of the mathlib4 branch `mycaule/semiSimplexCategory-reedy`

Declarations a proof of this repository needed and that were proposed to mathlib4 from
the fork mycaule/mathlib4, branch `mycaule/semiSimplexCategory-reedy`, closed upstream on
2026-10-22. They keep their mathlib names, against the pinned Mathlib; drop a
declaration once Mathlib has it.

# Direct categories

A category `C` is *direct* if it has a Reedy structure in which `W₁` consists of the identities
and `W₂` of all morphisms, i.e. a degree function on objects that every non-identity morphism
strictly raises.

We show that `C` is direct if and only if the relation "there is a non-identity morphism
`X ⟶ Y`" on the objects of `C` is well-founded:

* `HomotopicalAlgebra.ReedyStructure.ofWellFounded`: if this relation is well-founded, the rank
  of an object for it is a degree making `C` direct (with values in `Ordinal`);
* `HomotopicalAlgebra.ReedyStructure.wellFounded`: conversely, the relation is well-founded for
  any Reedy structure on `C` with `W₁ = identities C` and `W₂ = ⊤`.

# The semi-simplex category is direct

The category `SemiSimplexCategory` (finite nonempty ordinals and order embeddings) is a direct
category: every non-identity morphism `⦋n⦌ₛ ⟶ ⦋m⦌ₛ` satisfies `n < m`. Hence it has a Reedy
structure `SemiSimplexCategory.reedyStructure` in which `W₁` consists of the identities and
`W₂` of all morphisms, with degree `len`.
