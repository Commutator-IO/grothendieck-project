# Folder 44, page 4: integrality of the Cartan numbers from the axioms

The modernised reading `transcripts/44/44.modern.tex` (Appendice II, page 4) takes a
pair `(P, Δ)`, `P` free abelian of finite rank, `Δ ⊆ P` finite, with three axioms:

* a) `Δ` generates `P`;
* b) `a ∈ Δ ⇒ -a ∈ Δ`, and `n a ∉ Δ` for `n ≠ ±1`, `n ∈ ℚ` (reduced);
* c) for each `a ∈ Δ` a « symmetry » `S_a` with `S_a a = -a` and `S_a Δ = Δ`.

Writing `S_α x = x - ⟨γ_α, x⟩ α` with `γ_α ∈ (P')^ℚ`, the leaf states that in fact
`γ_α ∈ P'`, i.e. the Cartan numbers `⟨γ_α, β⟩` are integers, because `α` is
indivisible in `P`, « pouvant faire partie d'un système fondamental de racines ».
This is finding `44-cartan-integrality-from-axioms` of `src/content/findings.ts`.

What is formalised.

* `cartan_int_of_indivisible`: if `α` is indivisible in a subgroup `P` of a
  `ℚ`-vector space and `x - f x • α ∈ P` for `x ∈ P`, then `f x ∈ ℤ`. The step
  « indivisible ⇒ integral » holds in this generality (no freeness, no finiteness).
* The axioms a)–c) do not give it. In `P = ℤ²`,
  `Δ = {±3e₁, ±3e₂, ±(e₁ + e₂), ±(e₁ - e₂)}` satisfies a) (`generates`), b)
  (`neg_mem`, `reduced`, and `reduced_rat` with `n ∈ ℚ` as on the page) and c) (`symmetries`, the four reflections of the Weyl
  group of type `B₂`); the symmetry of `3e₁` of the form `x ↦ x - f(x)·3e₁` is
  unique and `f(e₁ + e₂) = 2/3` (`cartan_eq_two_thirds`, `cartan_not_int`),
  while `3e₁ = 3 • e₁` is divisible in `P` (`divisible`).
* In that example `3e₁` is in no integral fundamental system containing
  `e₂ - e₁` (`not_integral_base`): the simple system `{3e₁, e₂ - e₁}` of the
  reflection group is one only with rational coefficients, since
  `e₁ + e₂ = (2/3)·3e₁ + (e₂ - e₁)`.
