# Folder 55, page 13: Lemme B, the identity principle and noetherianity

Page 13 of folder 55 states, without proof, a « Lemme B »: let `X` be a ringed space which is
quasi-compact (i), with coherent structure sheaf (ii), noetherian local rings (iv), and which
satisfies an *identity principle* (v): for every coherent Ideal `𝒥`, with
`Y = (Supp 𝒪_X/𝒥, 𝒪_X/𝒥)`, every `y ∈ Y` where `𝒪_{Y,y}` is a domain has an open
neighbourhood `U` in `Y` on which every section of `𝒪_Y` vanishing near `y` vanishes. Then
every increasing sequence of coherent subsheaves of a coherent sheaf is stationary; and
(corollary, with Lemme A of page 5) `A = Γ(X, 𝒪_X)` is noetherian. See the modernised reading
`transcripts/55/55.modern.tex`, section « Le lemme B ».

Mathlib has no coherent sheaves on a ringed space, so this file proves the two steps of the
argument that do not depend on them, in a model where a subsheaf is a family of sets of
sections, stable under restriction and local:

* `stationary_of_locally_stationary`: on a quasi-compact space, an increasing sequence of
  subsheaves which is eventually constant on some neighbourhood of every point is eventually
  constant (the use of (i));
* `stationary_of_germs`: if at every point the germs stabilise (what (iv) gives, the stalk of
  a coherent sheaf being a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, see
  `germs_stabilize_of_noetherian`) and if equality of germs at `x` with a given term propagates
  to a *uniform* neighbourhood of `x` (the role the reading gives to (v)), the sequence is
  stationary — Lemme B, with (v) replaced by this uniformity;
* `isNoetherianRing_of_tilde`: the corollary — if finitely generated ideals `I` of a ring `A`
  go to members `Ĩ` of a class of objects with the ascending chain condition, monotonically and
  with `Γ(Ĩ) = I` (what Lemme A and its Corollaire 1 give), then `A` is noetherian;
* `not_stationary_without_uniformity`: the uniformity cannot be dropped — on `ℕ ∪ {∞}`, an
  increasing sequence of subsheaves whose germs stabilise everywhere but which accumulates
  at `∞` is not stationary.

Not formalised: that (v) implies the uniformity hypothesis of `stationary_of_germs` (the core of
Lemme B, which needs coherent sheaves, supports of `𝒪/𝒥` and a primary decomposition at the
stalk); the page gives no proof of it, and it is not checked here that (i)–(v) suffice for an
arbitrary ringed space.

On the one-point compactification `ℕ ∪ {∞}` (quasi-compact), with `F` the sheaf of all
`Bool`-valued functions, let `S k` be the subsheaf of functions which are `true` only at the
points `0, …, k - 1`. The germs stabilise at every point (from `0` at `∞`, from `n + 1` at `n`),
but the sequence is strictly increasing: the subsheaves accumulate at `∞`, the situation the
identity principle (v) is there to exclude. -/
