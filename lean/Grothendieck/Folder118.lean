# Folder 118, page 35: stability of `𝒲_A` under products without asphericity

The modernised reading `transcripts/118/118.modern.tex` (« Le lemme des pages 32 à 35 »)
shows that for a small category `A`, (i) « `A` totally aspherical » is equivalent to (ii)
« `𝒲_A` stable under finite products » plus « `A` aspherical », and asks on page 35
whether a connected `A` satisfying (ii) must be aspherical. The page answers « Non »:
for `A` a groupoid, `𝒲_A` consists of the isomorphisms only (for the usual weak
equivalences), hence is stable under finite products, while `A` is not aspherical. The
reading takes `A = BG` connected with `G ≠ 1`. This is the reachable part of finding
`118-groupoid-products-not-totally-aspherical` of `src/content/findings.ts`.

What is formalised, in a 1-truncated model. Presheaves on `BG` are `G`-sets, and for a
`G`-set `X` the category `A/X` is the action groupoid `X//G`. A functor between groupoids
is a weak equivalence (of nerves) iff it is bijective on connected components and an
isomorphism on automorphism groups; for the functor `X//G → Y//G` induced by a map `f` of
`G`-sets, this says that `f` is bijective on orbits and `Stab(f x) = Stab(x)`. That
characterisation of weak equivalences of groupoids is taken as the definition (`IsWeq`), not
proved; similarly `X//G` is aspherical iff it is connected with trivial automorphism groups
(`Aspherical`).

* `isWeq_iff_bijective`: `f ∈ 𝒲_A` iff `f` is bijective — the reading's reason
  (« a map of `G`-sets bijective on orbits and an isomorphism on stabilisers is an
  isomorphism »), and its converse.
* `isWeq_prod`, `isWeq_pi`: `𝒲_A` is stable under binary products and under products of
  any family, finite or not.
* `not_aspherical_point`, `not_aspherical_regular_prod`: for `G ≠ 1`, `A = A/e` is not
  aspherical, nor is `a × a` for the representable `a` (the regular `G`-set).
* `answer_page_35`: the three together.

/-! ### Cisinski, Astérisque 308, Proposition 4.3.2: (g) does not imply (c)

The comparison of this section with Cisinski's book is the edition's, not the page's.
Cisinski (*Les préfaisceaux comme modèles des types d'homotopie*, Astérisque 308, 2006,
doi:10.24033/ast.715), Proposition 4.3.2, lists conditions on a small category `A` claimed
equivalent, among them (c): for presheaves `X`, `Y` on `A`, the canonical functor
`A/(X × Y) → A/X × A/Y` is a weak equivalence, and (g): `𝒲_A` is stable under finite
products. For `A = BG`, `G ≠ 1`, (g)
holds (`condition_g_holds`) and (c) fails (`not_condition_c`; witnesses
`not_isWeqOver_regular`, `not_isWeqOver_point`), so (g) does not imply (c) (`g_not_imp_c`).
Cisinski confirmed on MathOverflow (https://mathoverflow.net/questions/516223, answer of
21 October 2026) that (g) ⇒ (c) needs a further assumption, e.g. that `A` be a test category.

Same 1-truncated model as above. A functor of action groupoids `X//G → Y//H` is given by a
group morphism `φ : G →* H` and a map `f : X → Y` with `f (g • x) = φ g • f x`; it is a weak
equivalence (`IsWeqOver`) iff it is bijective on orbits and `Stab(x) → Stab(f x)`, `g ↦ φ g`,
is bijective — again a definition, not proved from nerves. `A/X × A/Y` is the action
groupoid of `G × G` on `ExtProd X Y = X × Y`, and the canonical functor is
`(X × Y)//G → (X × Y)//(G × G)`, `(x, y) ↦ (x, y)`, `g ↦ (g, g)`. The direction (c) ⇒ (g),
which Cisinski keeps, holds in the model only because (g) always does (`condition_g_of_c`).
