# Folder 158, Proposition 1 (§5.1)

The modernised reading `transcripts/158/158.modern.tex`, §5.1 (manuscript
pages 44–46), states:

> **Proposition 1.** Soit `M` un monoïde *fini* dont le groupe enveloppant est
> trivial et qui est pseudo-cofiltrant. Alors il existe `p ∈ M` tel que
> `up = p` pour tout `u ∈ M` — en particulier `p² = p` — et `M` est cofiltrant.

It is proved here as the reading states it, with no hypothesis added. The
proof follows the reading's three steps:

1. (`etape1`) pseudo-cofilteringness and finiteness give a `p` lying in every
   principal right ideal `uM`;
2. `M` acts on itself by left multiplication, and `E₀ = pM` is contained in
   `u(E₀) = upM` for every `u`; since `E₀` is finite, the inclusion is an
   equality, so each `u` permutes `E₀`;
3. the resulting monoid morphism `M → Perm(E₀)` lands in a group, hence is
   trivial, which gives `up = p`.

What the formalisation shows. The finiteness the reading's footnote flags —
used silently on the leaf to turn `E₀ ⊆ u(E₀)` into `E₀ = u(E₀)` — is exactly
where the proof needs it: `Set.eq_of_subset_of_ncard_le` requires the finiteness
of `u(E₀)`, and `Finite.surjective_iff_bijective` (a surjection of `E₀` onto
itself is a permutation) requires that of `E₀`. Nothing else in the argument
uses finiteness except step 1, where it turns "any two `uM` meet" into "all
of them meet". No hypothesis turned out to be superfluous: without
pseudo-cofilteringness the monoid `{1, a, b}` with `a, b` left zeros
(`xy = x` for `x ≠ 1`) is finite with trivial group completion but has no such
`p`; without finiteness the reading's own §6 (`Ep(E)`, `E` infinite) is the
counterexample (not formalised here).

Conventions. "Pseudo-cofiltrant" is the reading's footnote definition,
`∀ u v, ∃ u' v', u u' = v v'`; "cofiltrant" adds the equalising clause on the
same side, `∀ u v, ∃ w, u w = v w`, which is the side the proof produces.
"Trivial group completion" is stated as: every monoid morphism from `M` to a
group is trivial. The groups quantified over are those in `M`'s universe; the
group completion of `M` lives there, so this is the same condition, and taking
fewer groups only weakens the hypothesis.

What the formalisation found. The Proposition holds as stated, but the
reading's modern gloss on it does not. The gloss says `p` « engendre un idéal
à gauche minimal réduit à un zéro à gauche : c'est le noyau de Rees du monoïde
fini, dont la trivialité du groupe enveloppant force qu'il soit ponctuel ».
`Mp = {p}` is indeed a minimal left ideal; but the kernel (minimal two-sided
ideal) is `MpM = pM`, which need not be a point, and `p` is neither unique nor
a two-sided zero: `contre_noyau_non_ponctuel` exhibits a three-element monoid
satisfying every hypothesis whose kernel has two elements. (Also, `u p = p` for
all `u` makes `p` what semigroup theory usually calls a *right* zero.) mathlib
has no structure theory of finite semigroups (kernels, completely simple
semigroups), so the proof is self-contained.
## Monoids with a minimal element (pages 21 to 41), finding `158-minimal-monoid-cofiltered`

A right `M`-set is `RSet M`; its category of elements has the elements as objects and
`m : x·m → x` as arrows. A functor from it to a group `G` is a cocycle
`c(x, mn) = c(x, m) c(x·m, n)`; `SimplyConnected` says every such cocycle, for every group
`G` in `M`'s universe, is a coboundary `g(x) g(x·m)⁻¹` — for a connected category this is
`π₁ = 1` (the equivalence with the fundamental group is not formalised). `ψ` is minimal if
`ψ ∈ uM` for every `u`.

* `cofiltrant_iff_simplyConnected`: a monoid with a minimal element is cofiltered iff every
  connected right `M`-set has a simply connected category of elements.
* `simplyConnected_of_cofiltrant`: the direction from cofiltered, for any monoid.
* `quotPsi_not_simplyConnected` (pp. 21–33, with `φ = ψ` as in the Corollaire of p. 33):
  if the powers of `ψ` are distinct, the relative degree `q − p` of `ψ^p u = ψ^q v` is a
  `ℤ`-valued cocycle on `M/R_ψ`, of degree `1` on the endomorphism `ψ` of the class of `1`.
* `cofiltrant_iff_rhoMin` (pp. 35–41): if `ψ^r = ψ^s`, `r ≠ s`, a power `e` of `ψ` is a
  minimal idempotent; left multiplication permutes the minimal elements `eM`, and `M` is
  cofiltered iff this representation `M → Perm(eM)` is trivial — otherwise the point fails.

What the formalisation found: the statement holds, and the Corollaire's dichotomy
works with `φ = ψ`: hypotheses (B), (C), (D) of pp. 22–30 reduce to « the powers of `ψ`
are distinct », (D) holding for `φ = ψ` by itself. The degree needs no
least object and no presentation of `π₁` (Proposition 1, p. 19): `ψ^p u = ψ^q u` forces
`p = q` for every `u` because `uM ∋ ψ`. In the other case, that the minimal elements form
`eM`, stable under left multiplication, is what makes `M → Perm(eM)` well defined, the step
p. 41 leaves under its illegible words. The `H¹(−, ℚ)` variant of p. 39 is not formalised.
## Finite categories (pages 50 to 53), finding `158-finite-category-cofiltered`

A presheaf is `Psh X`, with the same cocycle form of « simply connected »; (H), `HypH X`,
says every connected presheaf has a simply connected category of elements.

* `common_ancestor` (the doubling lemma, any category): under (H), two elements of a
  connected presheaf have a common ancestor — otherwise `F` glued to itself along the two
  disjoint subpresheaves they generate is connected and carries a `ℤ`-cocycle that is not a
  coboundary.
* `cone_objs_of_H`, `square_of_H`: (H) with `X` connected gives cones over pairs of objects
  (terminal presheaf) and squares over cospans (representables) — the step « (H) ⇒
  pseudo-cofiltrant » that p. 53 asserts without argument, for any category.
* `isCofiltered_of_H`: a finite, non-empty, connected category satisfying (H) is cofiltered
  (Mathlib's `IsCofiltered`). Proof as on pp. 50–52: an object `e` mapping to every object, a
  minimal idempotent `p` of `End e` (Proposition 1's step 1), the local system
  `L(z) = Hom(e, z) p` on the least objects (bijective transitions by counting), constant by
  (H), which gives `p c f = p c g`.
* `discrete_counterexample`: the discrete category on two objects satisfies (H) and is not
  cofiltered.

What the formalisation found: as read (« a finite category X such that every connected
presheaf… ») the statement is false for disconnected `X`; with `X` connected, as the page
must intend, it holds, and the unargued step holds for every small category.

/-! ### The modern gloss: the kernel need not be a point

The reading glosses Proposition 1 as: « `p` est un idempotent qui engendre un
idéal à gauche minimal réduit à un zéro à gauche : c'est le noyau de Rees du
monoïde fini, dont la trivialité du groupe enveloppant force qu'il soit
ponctuel ». The first half is right (`Mp = {p}` is a minimal left ideal, and
`p` absorbs whatever multiplies it on the left, i.e. `p` is what semigroup
theory usually calls a *right* zero). The second half is false: the kernel
(the minimal two-sided ideal) is `MpM = pM`, which need not be a point, and
`p` is neither unique nor a two-sided zero.

The counterexample is the smallest one: two right zeros `a`, `b`

A right `M`-set `X` is a presheaf on `B_M`; its category of elements `B_M/X` has the
elements of `X` as objects and `m : x·m → x` as arrows. A functor `B_M/X → B G`, `G` a
group, is a cocycle `c : X × M → G`, `c(x, 1) = 1`, `c(x, mn) = c(x, m) c(x·m, n)`; it is
isomorphic to the trivial functor iff `c(x, m) = g(x) g(x·m)⁻¹` for some `g`. For a
connected category, « every such functor is trivial, for every group `G` » is
`π₁ = 1`; this is the form of « simply connected » used here. -/
