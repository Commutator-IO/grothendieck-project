 * Builds his lexicon out of the transcriptions, for the next pass to read.

 *
 * What this is for. A pass reading a hard leaf is not usually choosing between
 * a word and no word; it is choosing between candidates, and the candidate
 * that wins is the one that belongs to *this* material. Folder 29 page 170
 * carries a stroke that reads « p—uncaux »; it is *principaux*, and nothing in
 * the ink says so — what says so is that the surrounding lines are classing
 * covering families, where principal is the word that occurs. A frequency list
 * of the register does not read a page, but it narrows the field, and it is
 * the one artefact here that can be built **now**, from what already exists.
 *
 * And it can be built from unverified transcriptions without circularity,
 * because it does not claim anything about ink. Whether page 170 really says
 * *principaux* is exactly the question a first pass cannot settle; that the
 * word *principal* is common in this material is settled by hundreds of other
 * occurrences, most of them nowhere near a doubtful stroke. A noisy corpus is
 * a poor teacher of letterforms and a perfectly good witness to vocabulary.
 *
 * Three things are kept apart on purpose, because conflating them is how a
 * guess would launder itself into an authority:
 *
 * — **Sure prose** — his words as read plainly, plus `\struck{}` (struck out
 *   but read) and `\marginal{}` (his margin, not ours).
 * — **Doubtful prose** — the contents of `\uncertain{}`, counted separately
 *   and reported separately. A word appearing *only* here is a reading this
 *   project has never once been confident about, and the file says so.
 * — **Ours, and therefore excluded** — `\note{}`, `\add{}`, every section
 *   heading, and the whole preamble. That prose is the transcriber's French,
 *   not Grothendieck's, and it would otherwise swamp the list with the
 *   vocabulary of the apparatus itself.
 *
 * Only `.fr.tex` is read. The modernised readings are in current notation and
 * current names by design; a lexicon built from them would describe the
 * editor's French of 2026, which is the opposite of what is wanted here.

# His lexicon, counted from the transcriptions

Built from **${x.files} batch files across ${x.folders.length} folders, ${x.pages} transcribed pages**, by \`scripts/lexicon.mjs\`. Words appearing fewer than ${x.min} times are omitted here; \`lexicon.json\` carries the full counts.

> **This is a witness to vocabulary, not to ink.** It is derived from first-pass
> machine transcriptions, **none of which has been checked against the leaves by
> a human** (\`transcripts/status.json\` records the checked ones, and there are
> none). Use it the way it is meant: to narrow a field of candidates for a
> stroke you cannot read. Never cite it as evidence that a particular page says
> a particular word — that is exactly the claim it cannot support.

Counted from his prose only. The transcriber's \`\\note{}\`, the editorial
\`\\add{}\`, the section headings and the preamble are excluded, or the list
would describe the apparatus rather than the material. \`\\struck{}\` and
\`\\marginal{}\` are counted — struck out is still written, and his margin is
his. Only \`.fr.tex\` is read: the modernised readings are in current French by
design.

**The corpus is bilingual, and not all of it is his.** Whole runs are in English
— his own reading notes on a typescript, and correspondence in both directions.
Letters *to* him are transcribed like everything else and cannot be separated
out mechanically, so a few hundred words here are Murre's rather than
Grothendieck's. Grammar words of both languages are filtered; the rest stands.

## His register

${table(cols(x.sure.slice(0, SHOWN * 3)), ['word', 'n', 'word', 'n', 'word', 'n'])}

## Abbreviations

Half of how he writes, and what most defeats a reader coming to the hand cold.

${table(cols(x.abbreviations.slice(0, SHOWN)), ['abbr.', 'n', 'abbr.', 'n', 'abbr.', 'n'])}

## Notation

Macros counted inside mathematics — what the notation of this fonds actually consists of.

${table(cols(x.macros.slice(0, SHOWN)), ['macro', 'n', 'macro', 'n', 'macro', 'n'])}

## Read only as doubtful, never plainly

Every occurrence of these is inside \`\\uncertain{}\`. **No pass has once been
confident of them.** A word here is a standing question, and finding it in a
candidate list is a reason to look harder at the page, not a reason to accept it.

${table(cols(x.onlyDoubtful.slice(0, SHOWN)), ['word', 'n', 'word', 'n', 'word', 'n'])}
