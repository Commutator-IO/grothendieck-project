/**
 * Compiles the transcripts' LaTeX into the PDFs offered for download.
 *
 *   npm run pdf              every transcript that has changed
 *   npm run pdf -- 19        one folder
 *
 * The PDF is the artifact for people who will not compile anything — a
 * supervisor, a reader on a train, an archive that wants a fixed page image.
 * It is compiled from the same `.tex` the reading view is rendered from, so
 * the three never disagree.
 *
 * A Unicode engine is required, not preferred: the transcriptions carry French
 * typography, Grothendieck's accented shorthand, and the occasional Greek or
 * German word, and `fontspec` in the preamble only works under XeTeX or LuaTeX.
 *
 * Tectonic is tried first, and is what CI uses. It is a single binary that
 * fetches the packages a document actually needs and caches them, so a runner
 * installs ~50 MB instead of a multi-gigabyte TeX Live — which is what makes it
 * reasonable to *build* these PDFs on every deploy rather than store them
 * anywhere. A local XeLaTeX is used if present, for people who already have one.
 *
 * With no engine at all this exits cleanly rather than failing the build: a
 * missing PDF costs a download button, not the site.
