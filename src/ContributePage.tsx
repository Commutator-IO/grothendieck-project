 * How to join in.
 *
 * The project's whole claim is that a machine reading is checkable, and a
 * claim nobody can act on is decoration. So this page is ordered by what it
 * costs the reader, not by what interests us: a button, then a pull request,
 * then a folder nobody has touched. Someone who only ever does the first is
 * doing the thing that matters most — they are the only person in the world
 * who knows that word is wrong.
 *
 * The skills are given as files to download rather than as a package to
 * install, because that is what they are: three Markdown files (one with a
 * companion specimen) that Claude Code reads out of a directory. Dressing
 * that up as an installer would hide the one fact worth knowing — you can
 * read the whole instruction set before you run it, and it is shorter than
 * this page.

          enforce it. There are exactly two exceptions — the{' '}
          <code>\keywords{'{}'}</code> line, which is English because it is a set of search
          keys pointing into an English literature, and everything outside the editions
          themselves: this site, the code, the commit messages and this page.
