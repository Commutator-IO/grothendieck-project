/**
 * The state of a batch: what exists, and what somebody has claimed.
 *
 * Every state is now settled in the repository, and none of it in the reader's
 * browser. That was the point of the change: a mark kept in local storage told
 * the person who made it something nobody else could see, and told them
 * nothing at all from a second machine. What a batch's state *is* belongs with
 * the batch.
 *
 * Two sources, and the difference is the whole design:
 *
 * — **Observed.** Whether a transcription exists, and whether a modernised
 *   reading exists, are facts about files. `npm run manifest` reads them, so
 *   `drafted` and `reviewed` are never written down anywhere and cannot go
 *   stale.
 * — **Declared.** Whether a pass is in flight, whether a person has sat with
 *   the facsimile and gone leaf by leaf, whether a batch was judged to hold
 *   nothing worth transcribing — no file can show any of that. Those three
 *   live in `transcripts/status.json`, where a change is a diff somebody can
 *   review.
 *
 * A progress table one believes to be automatic and which is not misleads more
 * than it informs; so does one that ignores what it can plainly see; and so
 * does one that lets a machine pass wear a human pass's name.
