/**
 * What the readings turned up that the inventory does not record.
 *
 * The page is a list of claims with a status attached, and the status is the
 * point. A page of findings without one would be a page of assertions, and
 * assertions about what other mathematicians did not do are the one thing this
 * project is in no position to make: the literature can be searched but never
 * exhausted, and almost nothing in the fonds is dated, so precedence is not
 * available to us about anyone.
 *
 * Hence two decisions that shape the layout. The status is a badge on every
 * row, never a footnote — a reader must not be able to take a candidate for a
 * result by skimming. And `matched` rows, the ones that turned out to be in
 * the books, stay on the page under their own heading rather than being
 * deleted: they are the evidence the list is pruned rather than grown, and
 * they save the next reader the search.
 *
 * Both survive the reworking below, which is about a third problem the first
 * two created. At forty-nine entries the page had become unreadable in a way
 * that had nothing to do with what it says: every row printed its four
 * apparatus fields at once, at one size, so the claim — the sentence a reader
 * came for — carried the same weight as the paragraph naming which section of
 * Johnstone to open. Three changes, in the order they matter:
 *
 *   - the rows are **grouped by shelfmark**, and a strip of chips indexes the
 *     folders and filters to one. Sixteen folders is too many to hold in the
 *     head while scrolling, and a reader who arrives from a commit message
 *     wants one of them;
 *   - `settle` — the one check that would decide a row — goes **behind a
 *     disclosure**. It is an instruction to whoever picks the row up, not a
 *     caveat, and the caveats all stay in the open: status, what the edition
 *     supplied, and what was searched are printed on every row as before,
 *     including when they are empty;
 *   - the prose is **capped at a measure**. The cards ran the width of the
 *     page, which at this size is ninety characters to the line; the site's
 *     own reading measure is 44em and the claim now respects it.
